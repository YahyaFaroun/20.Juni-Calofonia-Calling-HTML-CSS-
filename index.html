                <h1>Stuck in the middle.</h1>
                <p>Surrounded by smoke and inspired by the communities’ resilience, our design team reimagined the
                    California Grizzly and used it to create custom tees, pins and posters.</p>

                    exclusive pop-up shop during our SF Design Week Studio Crawl this Friday, June 21. You can choose
                    what amount to donate. All proceeds will go to the American Red Cross to help the communities that
                    are still displaced.</p>

                    <p>This design is all about the resilience of California to overcome difficult situations and come
                        out stronger than before. It’s a flip of the UNC Tarheel mascot with added elements like the
                        California poppy.</p>
